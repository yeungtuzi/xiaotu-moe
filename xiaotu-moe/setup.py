# xiaotu-moe wheel build: force correct platform/ABI-specific wheel tags.
#
# The native extension libraries are prebuilt .so files bundled as package data
# in xiaotu_moe/build/ (see pyproject.toml). Because they are plain data (not
# setuptools Extension objects), setuptools would otherwise tag the wheel
# "py3-none-any", which is wrong: the .so are cp312 / x86_64 specific and linked
# against glibc >= 2.34. We override bdist_wheel to emit a properly-tagged
# platform wheel so pip does not install it on incompatible targets.
